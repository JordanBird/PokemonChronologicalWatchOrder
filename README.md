# Pokemon Chronological Watch Order
Pokemon Chronological Watch Order is an in progress timeline for the viewing order of all media sources that are canon or linked to the main Pokemon series.

Most of the current information has been sourced from the original forum post by Kai_12, available here: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/217-pokemon/69236080.

The project is created with simple html, js and css with no specific development tools required to make contributing easier.
