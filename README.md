# Pokemon Chronological Watch Order
Do you ever wonder what order you should watch the Pokemon anime in and it's associated, movies, mini-series and shorts?

Pokemon Chronological Watch Order aims to be a timeline for the viewing order of all media sources that are canon or linked to the main Pokemon series.

The project is created with simple html, js and css with no specific development tools required to make contributing easier.

The timeline is hosted with GitHub pages, available here: https://jordanbird.github.io/PokemonChronologicalWatchOrder
